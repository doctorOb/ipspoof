% -- Introduction --
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A critical vulnerability exists within the very threading of the Internet. The world's infrastructure for information exchange focuses naively on the receiver of a transmission, without giving proper regards to who the sender is. Malicious attackers exploit this short sight in order to temporarily disable target servers by issuing more requests then the target can handle, a technique known as denial of service (Dos). An attacker who rapidly alters, or spoofs, the source IP address on traffic they generate cannot be tracked. Existing counter measures attempt to mitigate the effect of DoS attacks on the server, but fail to address the underlying issue at hand. 

Shue et. al propose an eloquent solution which effectively curbs IP spoofing at the source. In their approach, implementing routers inspect the source address of each packet, and ensure that it is a valid address within their subnet. Explicitly, if this router's subnet was 130.215.0.0/16 (that of the university this research was conducted under), and an encountered outgoing packet had a source IP of 176.230.1.5, the packet would be dropped. Should inspection pass, a unique tag (known by each other implementing router) which identifies the particular router, is added to the packet. Each downstream router en route to the destination checks for the presence of such a tag, and adds its own if one is found. Their analysis shows that their protocol is able to deny spoofed IP packets from entering the larger network at a rate nearing 100\%. The catch, however, is that this effectiveness is contingent on a high deployment status.
